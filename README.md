# T9 Predective Texter

A simple web application that somewhat emulates the T9 texter from all thoseyears ago. While there is no reason for anyone to ever use this, it was really fun and interesting to create.

###Tech Used

  - Sinatra 
  - Bootstrap
  - Jquery

To solve this problem, I first take the users input (each number is mapped to either a string of 3 or 4 unique characters) in the form of keypad clicks. After each button click, I generate a list of all possible permutations of the users input up to that point. The algorithm to find all permutations takes approximately O(3<sup>n</sup>) time. I then look up each permutation in a Trie I created containing a subset of every word in the English language. For the text prediction, I take each permutation and see if there is a node within the Trie that corresponds to this sequence of characters. If there is a correspinding node, I then perform a Depth-First search at that node to try and find all words that have the given permutation as a prefix, and has a length of `prefix.length + n`.

### Todo's

- Building the Trie takes approximately 4 seconds. I would like to speed this up by breaking the task up into threads to build the Trie in parallel.
- Hovering over a word will display its definition.
